#Mod Config Reborn

**Gagarin Patch Compatible**

Mod Config Reborn is the next generation version of WayWockets original Mod Config.
Built as a team effort to keep this essential mod alive on the workshop through this and future patch releases.

Mod Config Reborn cannot be used with Surviving Mars versions less than Gagarin (Space Race)

####For the Player

####For the Modder

Gagarin (Space Race) is significantly different from previous versions of the game.

You will need to make minor adjustments otherwise Mod Config will not work properly with your mod.

####Legacy Data
This version will not carry over any of the original Mod Config data settings.
All settings will default to the mods defaults upon running this mod.

####Acknowledgements
A great big shout out and hearty acknowledgement goes to Waywocket, who built Mod Config way back when Surviving Mars first came out.
His foresight into the modding realm allowed modders such as myself and many others to offer "adjustment parameters" to their own mods making them rich with features that otherwise would be static in nature.
Since the inception, this mod has been an essential part of Surviving Mars and the modder community, and on behalf of the modder community, thank you for your work.

Thank you ChoGGi for your great coding skills leant to this project
